## Props

<Controls />

## Usage as Paper

Card can be used a wrapper or container for other components, like a `Paper`, by simply passing the sub-components as
children. This quickly adds some padding, a border, and a subtle background color.

## Nesting Cards

Cards can be nested inside other cards, which would create a "card stack" effect. This is useful for creating a
hierarchical information structure.

<Story of={CardStories.NestedCards} />

This can also be done with custom content, without `title` or `description` props, by simply nesting the cards.

<Story of={CardStories.NestedCardsWithCustomContent} />
