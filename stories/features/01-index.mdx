# Features

While designing Chaya UI, our goal was to abstract away as much code and complexity as possible from the downstream
applications, while still providing a powerful and flexible set of tools for building interfaces downstream.

### Data-First Approach

Our components are opinionated to be data-first, which means that they can consume data directly, without needing
extra components or mapping functions. This makes it easier to consume data from APIs, and reduces the amount of
boilerplate code that you need to write (less composition, more flexible / powerful base components).

For example, this is how you would normally create a select input with other popular libraries  -
```jsx
<Label>Select Item</Label>
<Select placeholder="Select">
  {data.map((item) => (
    <option key={item.id} value={item.id}>{item.name}</option>
  ))}
</Select>
```

In Chaya, the same code would look like this -
```jsx
<SimpleSelect
    label="Select Item"
    placeholder="Select"
    items={data.map((i) => ({ label: i.name, value: i.id }))}
/>
```

This design choice and approach becomes even more obvious with more complex components like Tables, where you
normally would -
```tsx
<TableContainer>
  <Table variant='simple'>
    <Thead>
      <Tr>
        <Th>To convert</Th>
        <Th>into</Th>
        <Th isNumeric>multiply by</Th>
      </Tr>
    </Thead>
    <Tbody>
      <Tr>
        <Td>inches</Td>
        <Td>millimetres (mm)</Td>
        <Td isNumeric>25.4</Td>
      </Tr>
    </Tbody>
  </Table>
</TableContainer>
```

With ChayaUI, this becomes -

```tsx
<DataTable
    properties={[
        { label: 'To convert', key: 'from', value: (i) => i.from },
        { label: 'into', key: 'to', value: (i) => i.to },
        { label: 'multiply by', key: 'factor', textAlign: 'right', value: (i) => i.factor },
    ]}
    data={[
        { id: '1', from: 'inches', to: 'millimetres (mm)', factor: 25.4 },
    ]}
/>
```

Because we use typescript generics, you can be sure that the data you pass into the components is correct, and
`value: (i) => i.from` will be type-checked against the data you pass in, and in-fact you will get auto-complete
for not just the props, or `properties`, but also for the value `i`.

We do not claim that our approach is better than the other, but it is certainly different, and for us
it has been more convenient and less error-prone. We follow this approach consistently across all our components,
and **rarely have sub-components that need to be used in conjunction with the main component**.

We, thus, **do not follow the principle of composition**, which we understand is an anti-pattern in React,
but we believe that it is a trade-off we make.

### Type-Safety & Built-in Documentation

Chaya UI is built with TypeScript, which means that you can be sure that your components are used correctly, and
that data is passed into and out of the components correctly with type-safety.

It can be often difficult to learn a new component library and understand its API. Thanks to TypeScript, and
`react-docgen-typescript`, and our simple and consistent API, you can easily understand the API of each component.
We also accept and use typescript generics for our components so that our callbacks and props are type-safe.


### Styling

All styling in Chaya UI is done with **Tailwind CSS**, which is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build
beautiful and responsive interfaces with minimal CSS. Our components are designed to be minimal and modern, and
are designed to be easy to be overridden with in-built props such as `variant`, `size`, `color` etc., your own
custom tailwind classes, or your own CSS overrides.

All our components expose atleast one `className` prop, which allows you to add your own custom tailwind classes,
and many expose more specific `className` props that allow you to style the component in a more granular way.
We sometimes also expose `style` props, which allow you to add your own custom CSS styles.

We let you _*compile the tailwind CSS for the components in your downstream application*_, so that you can customize
and override the styles as you see fit.

### Theming

ChayaUI supports **Runtime Theming** out of the box. You can easily change the theme of your application at runtime
(such as based on tenant, user preferences, etc) by changing the theme object that you pass to the `ThemeProvider`,
and all the components will automatically update to reflect the new theme.

ChayaUI also of-course supports **Dark Mode** out of the box, but goes a step further by integrating it with the
theme, and **automatically deciding whether the UI must be in dark or light scheme based on the theme colors**. All
components are designed to work well in both light and dark color themes.

Such as if your theme has a dark background color, the text color will automatically switch to white, and vice-versa.
We do not require you to pass any additional props to enable dark mode, it just works out of the box, based on
the theme colors.

If you need a switch to toggle dark mode in your application, simply switch the theme colors provided to the
`ThemeProvider`, and the components will automatically switch to the appropriate mode.


### Accessibility

Chaya UI is built on top of **Radix Primitives**, which provides a solid foundation for building accessible
and responsive components.

We have used native HTML elements and attributes, whenever available and appropriate, instead of purely styling
generic html elements, which makes our components more accessible.

Our components also support **Keyboard Navigation**, and **Screen Readers**, and have been written with
correct ARIA attributes and semantics.
